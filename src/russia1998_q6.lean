Russian Mathematical Olympiad 1998, Problem 6

Two circles meet at P and Q. A line intersects segment PQ and meets the circles at points
A, B, C, and D, in that order. Prove that ∠APB = ∠CQD.

Solution:
C is between B and D. Since the line passes through segment PQ, convex quadrilaterals
APCQ and BPDQ are cyclic. Then

∠APB = ∠APQ - ∠BPQ
      = ∠ACQ - ∠BDQ
      = ∠DQC.
